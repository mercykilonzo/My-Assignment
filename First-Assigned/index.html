    <img src="images/first meeting.jpeg" style="width: 400px;height: 300px;">
    <p>The week began with a meeting with the administration. This meeting was to help us familiarize with the environment.
        <span> After which we went to our respective classes were everyone had to find their sitting places and laptop.</span>
        <span> This was easy since each chair and laptop had the students code on it. Then we had to confirm if our laptops were okay and operating as required.</span></p>
    <p>During the same week, we had afew classes  which were an introduction to some of the items we will use during the program like; google docs, spreadsheets, git, slides and email. 
        <span>This gave us a chance to meet some of the trainers who will be taking us through the different units.</span></p>    
    <p>Towards the end of the week, we had another meeting with Nancy and Wilter. They shared with us the timetable and routine for both the weekdays and weekend.</p>
